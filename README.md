### 11/29/2017: Dead Man's Slope

|[![Dead Man's Slope](img/mogulneer_18.gif)](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30307)|
|--------|
|Started while snowed in one winter and ended up with a driving model inspired more by mario kart and some skiing physics.  Fun things:
- My first experiment with authored levels, which were described using a simple DSL in lua. 
- The other thing I think is worked well in this is that the player avatar is a mix of sprites (the body) and procedural graphics (the skis).
- Because the skis are rotating smoothly it makes the whole character feel better than the simple 8 frames or so of actual sprite there is.
- It was also fun tuning the camera and particle effects to sell the speed and turns.
- The course boundaries are drawn procedurally using splines|

# Smaller Projects

Smaller projects - libraries, tests, tweet carts, all kinds of fun.

## Libraries (Quadplay)

These quadplay libraries help me get prototypes and jam games up and running quickly.

|[Acceleration Demo](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=examples/accel_demo)|[Bounce Demo](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=examples/sproing)|[Camera Shake](https://morgan3d.github.io/quadplay/console/quadplay.html?game=examples/camera_shake)|
|----|----|----|
|![Acceleration Demo](img/Acceleration_Library_Demo_2020-08-19_21h03.gif)|![Bounce Demo](img/Squash_and_Stretch_Example_2020-12-06_20h12.gif)|![Camera Shake](img/camera_shake_2020-07-05_14h21.gif)|
|While struggling with Beat the Gobblins, I stumbled across a GMTK video about [celeste's game feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yorTG9at90g&vl=en), and after seeing the graphs I  realized I could model those accelerations really simply using an ADSR model inspired by Steve Swink's [Game Feel](http://www.game-feel.com) book.  This test proved to be super useful, and I've cleaned it up into a very simple module I've since used on a number of projects.  Its driven off just three parameters: acceleration time from 0 to full speed (in frames), deceleration time from full speed to 0 under no acceleration (in frames) and maximum speed (in px/f).  You can see the table [here](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay/blob/2bc3f95cc5ce6960b6071d82b494b65428fb9ffd/examples/accel_demo/accel_lib.pyxl#L90) and further explanation [here](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay/blob/2bc3f95cc5ce6960b6071d82b494b65428fb9ffd/examples/accel_demo/accel_lib.pyxl#L1).|The bounce demo is based on @fourbitfriday's bounce demo from [a stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/576377070).  Again, it is built into an easy to integrate library and features a similar "profile" system as the acceleration library.|Every game needs camera shake!

## Pico8

Before shifting over to quadplay for personal projects, I really fell in love with pico8.

### Pico8 Basecode
The basecode for all the projects that Steve Lavietes and I collaborated on in pico8: 

* [Source](https://github.com/ssteinbach/pico8carts/blob/master/stdlib.p8)

Designed to be stripped down at the end of a project to recover tokens.

Includes:

* Menu system
* Debug tools
* Object/Transform hierarchy (+coordinate systems)
* Morgan McGuire's Pico8 particle system library
* Camera system
* Mouse input
