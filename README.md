|Based on Tetris Attack, first shipped project in pico8.|Done right before GDC in 2017|Attempt at a small game done quickly, wanted to try and do something that wasn't an adaptation.|Started while snowed in one winter and thinking back on ski free (although plays nothing like that game).|Steve and I returned to Tetris Attack after having worked on a megadrive version, as an homage to the awesome pico8 community.  Features music by tesselode and art from a variety of great games from the pico8 community that inspired us!|

|wanted to learn about procedural generation and raymarching.  planet generation algorithm is my interpretation of an algorithm from star control 2.  All of the generation was done offline in C++ and then ported to ISPC.  The rendering is entirely in a GLSL shader.|Had a cool level editor by @stevelavietes| |
